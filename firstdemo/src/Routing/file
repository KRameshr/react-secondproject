Roughting it is process of navigation from one page to another page with in a single page.
with help of create a sap single page of application

handing Naigation is called routing
routing in single page and apps
to reloade to next page is called routing
react is called single page application
npm i react-router-dom --save

components of react router
browser router is to top level componet call at the component
routes switch in v5 It is a parent of the router It search in the child router to match the path with url
route we define path and load component
link for hyperlink
child route are nested routes
out use for nested routes or child routes lode

parameter(params) : they are dynamic parts of the url that can chage and set to a specific value when a particular route is match
params are passed through the URL.

two type

1.Route params
we can pass the parameters through URl and get these parameter data
with the help of useparams() hook in react router
eg :
http://localhost:3000/gallery/mens

 <!-- <Route path="gallery/:cat" element={products/} -->

gallery componet
const {cat} = use params()

this are called dynamic route immplementation
2.query params (query string)
they are a key-vlue pair added to the end of the URL to
provide additional information to the server they are used to filter or sort data,pass
?Key =value & key = value.

 <Link to="gallery?ser = 123">Gallery</Link>
 navigate("/services?search=" + serch);
 useserchparams :to ger the query param value
usenavigate() in react Router

context or context APi it is used to manage global state,for this we dont need any third party library It i inbulid in our react library

create content
provider
consumer
first we create a content and that context to the parent componet with values and we can consome this context in any of the child and subchild of the paree
anywhere
when tkere is any chanhe in the context it automatic updated where it consume

       or

-> Routing : It is a process to navigate from one link to another within a single page.
-> with the help of routing we can create SPA (Single Page Application)
-> In React to perform routing we have React Router library (3rd party library)
-> to install it
npm i react-router-dom --save (V6)

    -> Components of react router
       -> BrowserRouter : Top level component . Call at the top of the application . Within it we can define all routing implementation.
       -> Routes : Switch in V5. It is a parent of the Route. It search in the child Route to match the path with URL
       -> Route : we define path and load component
         eg:
            <Routes>
               <Route path="" element={<Home />}/>
               <Route path="about" element={<About />}/>
            </Routes>
       -> Link :- for hyperlink
          <Link to="/"> Home </Link>
          <Link to="/about"> About Us </Link>
       -> Outlet : used for nested routes or child routes

        Task
    Home  About Us   Services  Gallery  Contact Us
    <section>
      //load component when a url is match with the route
    </section>

    -> Child route or nested route
       Outlet Component

       10 minute break

    -> Parameter (Params) : They are dynamic parts of the URL that can change and set to a specific value when a particular route is match.
      Params are passed through the URL.
        -> Route Params
        -> Query Params
      -> Route Params : We can pass the parameters through URl and get these parameter data with the help of useParams() hook in React Router.
        eg:
            http://localhost:3000/products/mens

            <Route path="products/:cat" element={<Products />}/>
            -> Products COmponent
            const {cat}=useParams();
    -> Query Parameter (query string): They are a key-value pair added to the end of the URL to provide additional information to the server. They are used to filter or sort data, pass search terms , or provide pagination information.
       ?key=value&key=value..

         <Link to="/gallery?ser=123"> Gallery </Link>
         useSearchParams :to get the query param values
    -> useNavigate() in React Router for navigation

-> Context or Context API : It is used to manage global state.For this we dont need any 3rd party library. It is inbuild in our react library.
-> 3 steps 1. create context 2. Provider 3. Consumer
-> First we create a context and provide that context to the parent component with values and we can consume this context in any of the child and subchild of the parent component anywhere.
-> When there is any change in the context it automatically updated where it is consume.
